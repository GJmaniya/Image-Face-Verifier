# Image-Face-Verifier
This Face Matching Application uses DeepFace to compare faces from a folder of test images against multiple training images. Matched images are moved to a specified folder. It validates inputs, restricts use to a set date range, and allows users to decide whether to continue or exit after each run.

## Overview
FaceMatchTool is a Python-based utility for face comparison using the DeepFace library. It allows users to compare images in a test folder against multiple training images to identify matches. Matched images are then moved to a specified folder for further use or organization. The application is designed for batch processing and is intuitive to use, offering features like validation of input images, error handling, and an interactive workflow.
